# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Planning

## High Level Design
There would be a heading called "Tic Tac Toe". Below the main heading, have a heading to display the player who is playing. The game would consist of a three by three grid with nine squares. The user input would be based on clicks on the squares. After each click, the player's mark would be displayed on the square and a check would be done to see if the player has completed three marks in a line. In this case, display that the player has won. If not, prompt the next player to play.
